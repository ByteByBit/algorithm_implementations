# Floyd-Warshall Algorithm

<p>The Floyd-Warshall Algorithm is used for solving All Pairs Shortest Path problem. The problem is to find shortest distances between every pair of vertices in a given edge weighted directed Graph. </p>
<p>Time complexity:</p>
<ul>
    <li>O(V<sup>3</sup>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Space complexity:</p>
<ul>
    <li>O(V<sup>2</sup>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Where V represents the vertices.</p>
