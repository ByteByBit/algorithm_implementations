# Depth First Search Algorithm

<h2>Time complexity: O(V+E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph.<br>
Space complexity: O(V), where V is the number of vertices in the graph.</h2>
<h2>Implementation:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Store the graph in a dictionary</li>
    <li>Create the visited list: store here the already visited vertices/ nodes</li>
    <li>Start node from the selected node and mark it visited</li>
    <li>Get the node right below it</li>
    <li>Start over until we have nodes</li>

</ul>
<h3>The difference between Breadth First Search and Depth First Search is: BFS first goes horizontal, then vertical, while DFS the opposite way.</h3>
